			<h2>The Firm</h2>
			
			<p id="padding">
				
				<img src="images/pexels-houzlook-com-3356416.jpg"/>
				
				Orton Architects is a Pretoria-based design practice founded
				on the ideas that buildings can build a bridge between culture,
				nature and people, and that inspiring buildings can have a 
				positive effect on people’s lives.
			
				<br />
			
				We also value every engineer, contractor and craftsman who forms
				an intricate part of the success of our projects. Their knowledge
				of construction and system performance is integral to any design
				and leads to sustainable and practical buildings.
			
				<br />
			
				Another important team member is the client of course. We have had
				the opportunity to work with amazing individuals and families who
				not only supported, but also inspired and challenged us. Through
				their dreams we are given the opportunity to realize our own.
			
				<br />
			
				The firm began its creative existence in 2010 with the architect
				Jacques Orton, who strongly believes that buildings can serve as
				a bridge between culture, nature, history and people, and that
				inspiring surroundings have a positive effect on people’s lives.
			
				<br />
			
				We believe that architecture should be rooted to its particular
				place by using the best local materials and craftsmen. Our vision
				is to create buildings that are environmentally responsive, 
				authentic, artful, tactile and modern.
			
				<br />
				
				While we are very proud of the buildings we design, we derive a
				great sense of accomplishment from our “family” of talented
				individuals we have assembled around us.

				<h2>PUBLICATIONS & RECOGNITION</h2>
				<p>Among the firm’s accolades is the 2010 Innovative Learning through ETDs Award.</p>

			<p>
				‘His plans to revitalize an aging urban centre in the outskirts of
    			Pretoria are now the talk of scholars and urban planners who are
				advocating for legislative policy change.  His vision presents the 
				tremendous potential to turn-around the poverty ravaged areas of
				his home town and transform this region through micro-economic
				development and provide a model for others around the world
				including developers in far-away Detroit, Michigan and many
				other gentrified urban centres’.

				Articles on the firm’s work include: TUIS magazine (Feb 2015)
				, SA Home Owner (Aug 2016), SA Home Owner (Sept 2018).

			<h2>WORKING WITH ARTISTS AND CRAFTSPEOPLE</h2>
			
			<p>
				Often, architecture becomes the vessel that supports specific art
				installations. In many of its projects, the firm works with artists
				& craftspeople to fabricate specific elements that support the overall
				design. Buildings are collaborative efforts that involve not just the
				architect, but the contractor and the workers as well. Craft is an
				outgrowth of Orton Architects contextual approach to design, as
				working with these artists helps our work tell an authentic story of its place.
