			<p>
				We believe that sustainability in the built environment is not a luxury that can
				be avoided or taken lightly in the design of any Project.  Sustainability is an
				unavoidable necessity which forms an essential part of every design and should
				be treated with utmost care and respect and responsibility.
				
				<br />
				<br />
				In our experience, we have seen that sustainable design does not have
				to have a large cost implication, as energy efficiency can be implemented
				from a basic prudent approach, applying “back to basics” principles of good design.
				Sustainability can be upgraded from good energy efficient design, all the way up
				using “state of the art” cutting edge technologies, to make best use of various
				renewable energies.
			</p>

			<h2>Goals of Sustainable Design:</h2>
			<p>
			Reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health. 
			
				<br />
				<br />

				At Hofman Architects we have educated ourselves to be experts in responsible sustainable design. 
				We believe that every Project – no matter how big or small – will benefit from well considered
				sustainable design principles – providing obvious benefits to all the users of the building in
				the short term – to the owners of the building in the medium term – with obvious benefit to the
				overall environment and the planet in the long term.

			<p>
				By designing in harmony with the land, we create buildings that, through their massing, 
				materials and orientation are sustainable. Homes should be designed to receive the maximum 
				amount of northern sunlight and not be cramped gloomy boxes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Passive design and keeping the carbon footprint as low as possible should always be 
				paramount. They should be easy to upgrade, built to last and designed so that new 
				features can be added easily.
			</p>
			<p>
			The building materials should be tough, tactile and durable. They should age well, 
			have a low environmental impact and offer its inhabitants a primed canvas upon 
			which they can personalize their lives.

			<h2>Cost and Payoff:</h2>
				
			<p>	
				Apart from the obvious long-term benefits to humanity and the planet, the initial additional
				input cost must be offset and evaluated against the savings after implementation of the systems.
				Some obvious savings, such as savings in energy cost like electricity and water etc. are relatively
				easy to calculate.  Others, such as the benefits to human health and savings on health-related
				issues and medical bills, or higher productivity due to improved living and working conditions in the
				longer term, are more difficult to evaluate.

				The calculation to weigh initial input cost against the long-term savings in running the and 
				maintenance cost is called Life cycle costing.  This Life Cycle Costing will determine the Break-even
				Point where the additional cost is canceled out by the savings in running cost.  Knowledge of the 
				up-front cost and accurate life cycle costing is essential to make informed decisions for the Project.
			</p>

			<h2>Process:</h2>
			<p>
				We follow the standard Professional Work Stages involved in the design, documentation and 
				construction of a Project.  In each stage we consider the added benefit of sustainability 
				of each choice and decision.
			</p>
				​
				
			<h2>Green Start Ratings – Building Certification:</h2>
			<p>
				As Green Star Building Accredited Professionals, we can manage the Green Star Certification and guide you through the process.

				Rating Tools exist for New Buildings; Existing Building Performance; Interiors, Multi-unit residential.
